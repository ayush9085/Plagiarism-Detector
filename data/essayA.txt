Artificial intelligence is becoming an essential part of modern technology. 
Everyday applications such as smartphones, search engines, and recommendation 
systems rely heavily on machine learning algorithms. These systems analyze 
large amounts of data and identify useful patterns. As a result, industries 
like healthcare, finance, and transportation are rapidly adopting AI-based 
solutions to improve efficiency and accuracy. However, it is equally important 
to understand the ethical concerns and ensure that AI technology is used 
responsibly.
